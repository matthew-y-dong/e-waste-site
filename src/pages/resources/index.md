### General e-waste resources

#### [Berkeley Community Conservation Centers](http://berkeleyrecycling.org/index.php)

Community Conservation Centers (CCC) has been operating Berkeley Recycling at Second and Gilman Streets in Berkeley since September 1982. CCC operates programs that buy recyclables and provides for convenient drop-off of recyclables. The City-owned facility is also home to the Ecology Center, which operates the residential curbside pick-up program. The City of Berkeley operates the commercial pick-up program which collects recyclables from commercial establishments throughout the city. Together, the three programs collect about 18,000 tons per year of various materials, including newspaper, cardboard, glass and plastic bottles, scrap metals and household hazardous waste. The following are programs operated by CCC.

Each year in California hundreds of thousands of computers, monitors, copiers, fax machines, printers, televisions, and other electronic items become "obsolete" in the eyes of consumers. Rapid advances in technology and an expanding demand for new features accelerate the generation of "old" electronic equipment ("e-waste"). The result is a growing challenge for businesses, residents, and local governments as they search for ways to reuse, recycle, or properly dispose of this equipment.

Many components of electronic equipment--including metals, plastic, and glass--can be recycled, while others may present environmental hazards if not managed correctly. This site provides information and resources on how to properly manage your electronic products.
