  title: Welcome to a website about e-waste!
  description: >
    Electronics have become a prevalent portion of our everyday lives in the modern technological era.  However, few of the many devices that consumers purchase in the US are properly recycled for various reasons such as lack of convenient recycling options, lack of education regarding e-waste, and general throwaway culture.  
    E-waste is an issue because electronics are resource intensive goods and often parts of devices that are landfilled could be recovered and reused - saving energy needed to mine new metals or produce more plastics.  Furthermore hazardous materials in electronic products threaten both human and environmental health.  
    This website explores the current trends of electronic good usage along with research on electronic waste policies and end-of-life recycling practices.

    #     We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
    #     That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
    #     space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
    #     coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
    #     sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
